        <p class="lead mb-4"> One Of My Favorite Text In My Teaching - The people and world seem to see change every day but without a doubt the most formidable one would be without a doubt the social contract and its influence in society. Many individuals argued and brought amazing theories in society which we reference even to this day. One of them being the well-known Rousseau, Paine, L'Ouverture, and Bolivar. These iconic figures brought upon ideas in society which we would have never thought to think would come back to us. One of my main focuses is the one and only Rousseau and his Social Contract. Rousseau showed ideology in which would bring and support such individuals and citizens as it should be. It should be noted that the social contract is well versed and even similar to that of the Constitution. These basic rights and agreements between the government also can be shown to have some notes on slavery, the idea of slavery in the social contract is very vague but it can be said that those born in chains are every much so free than those who aren't. The contract can also be said and if were fully incorporated to free not only people but countries and the tyranny of people and powers.  Countries like the U.S. and those like Latin America could have used these ages ago and even now some sort of idea of this has been used. The U.S. specifically has used these ideas and it's a good thing they did, the tyranny of the U.K. was absolutely horrendous, and it was because of this that the social contract not only aimed for people to work together with the government, but also to make a great society between themselves and others so that no absolute tyranny would happen. The same ideas of a being able to form a solid relationship and agreement with the government of the social contract was breeched by the U.K. and it's because of this that a separation was needed. These same ideas are seen in the constitution itself! Here's a quote from the constitution and the ideas between the U.K. and the U.S. "But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. --Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world." "(In Congress, July 4, 1776) The Declaration of Independence." This passage really shows what the enslavement of people does and what to fight for. It is because of this that the social contract is brought upon and many ideas and things we see can be tracked to even present day today. Many enslaved countries have taken notice and have taken this route, but others aren't as lucky. Hopefully the social contract can be reformed and fixed and made even better with time, the amendment is proof of that and with time it might even be possible to reform other places that need it.<br><br>
